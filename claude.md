claude.md - waheeeeipages Static Hosting Rules (Project-per-Directory) Repository Local repo root: /Users/k.yamamoto/waheeeeipages Hosting: GitHub -> Cloudflare Pages Build step: None (pure static hosting) Goal Generate and update simple static HTML/CSS/JS files for small projects ("案件") and publish them by committing and pushing to GitHub. Directory Policy (IMPORTANT) This repository is managed per project directory. Rule: Always place new HTML under a project directory Do NOT place project HTML directly at the repo root. Each project lives under: projects/<project_slug>/ Examples: projects/sample-lp/index.html projects/shop-promo/index.html Workflow Rule (MANDATORY) Before generating or modifying any HTML, ALWAYS ask the user: Step 1: Choose directory Ask: A) Create a new project directory B) Use an existing project directory If existing directories are known, list them. Step 2A: If creating a new directory Ask: Project name (human readable) Directory slug (lowercase, hyphen-separated — propose one) Then: Create directory: projects/<slug>/ Create HTML as: projects/<slug>/index.html Step 2B: If using an existing directory Ask: What HTML file name should be generated or updated? Default suggestion: index.html But allow: xxx.html Then generate or update: projects/<existing>/YOUR_FILENAME.html Minimal HTML Standards Every HTML file must include: <meta charset="utf-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> <title>...</title> Tech Policy Use: Plain HTML Plain CSS Minimal JS when needed Avoid: Frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) Build tools npm / package.json Heavy external libraries Git Rules (ALWAYS AFTER CHANGES) After generating or editing files, always run: git status git add . git commit -m "meaningful message" git push Commit message style Short English sentence. Examples: Add new landing page for sample-lp Update hero section layout Fix mobile spacing Prohibited Adding build steps Adding secrets (API keys, tokens) Changing static hosting assumptions Useful Commands List project directories: ls -la projects Open repo in Finder: open /Users/k.yamamoto/waheeeeipages Deployment Cloudflare Pages auto deploys on every push to main. Ensure layout and links are not broken before pushing.
